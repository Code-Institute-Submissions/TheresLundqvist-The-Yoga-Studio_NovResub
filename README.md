## **Bugs**

* When I deployed my project to Github pages I discovered my project was broken, the links to the other files (CSS, blog and gallery) dit not work. I discovered this was because I had used absolute file paths in my code.  
When I removed the / from the start of the path the problem was fixed.

## **Validator testing**

* HTML  
  
Four errors occured for the blog page since I used h1-headings on three occations i blog.html, when I replaced them the errors disapeared. One warning in Gallery page due to section without heading,  
solved that by adding a div element and removing section. From the home page one error remains due to a bug. See *unfixed bug section*. The errors were fixed and all pages besides the home page passed validation afterwards.

### **Unfixed Bugs**

* One remaining bug due to the option element "Element option without attribute label must not be empty."  
I've tried to apply a label for each option and remove text in between - same error. Tried to removing space between text - same error. Seems to be a bug.
