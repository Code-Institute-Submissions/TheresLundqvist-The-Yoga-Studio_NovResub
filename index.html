                    Our yoga classes are individually adapted, varied and incredibly beneficial. They are very carefully designed so that everyone can take part in the classes and get the most out of their yoga practice. 
                    <br><br>
                    Whether it's to get softer, stronger, get better balance, rehabilitate from an injury, deal with fatigue symptoms or just for increased well-being.
                    All yoga is performed in pleasant warmth to give the body the opportunity to relax. 
                    <br><br>
                    As a student with us, you should be able to safely participate in all classes and meet according to your needs, conditions and thus achieve the best results for you.

                <p>
                    We are one of Luleå's oldest and most experienced yoga studios with solid knowledge in the various branches of yoga. 
                    We have the competence to meet all kinds of people - with or without injuries, illnesses and with varying needs, physical capacity and experience.
                    <br><br>
                    Our goal is that you who come to us should feel safe, included and part of our community, while at the same time experiencing positive change in your life as a result of yoga.
                    <br><br>
                    We want to help you create the conditions for a yoga practice and a life that gives energy instead of taking and that creates a greater balance. 
                    We stand for quality, results and warmth, all in a professional and at the same time easy-going spirit.
