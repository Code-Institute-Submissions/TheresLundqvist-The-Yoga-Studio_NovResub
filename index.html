                    Our yoga classes are individually adapted, varied and incredibly beneficial. They are very carefully designed so that everyone can take part in the classes and get the most out of their yoga practice. 
                    <br><br>
                    Whether it's to get softer, stronger, get better balance, rehabilitate from an injury, deal with fatigue symptoms or just for increased well-being.
                    All yoga is performed in pleasant warmth to give the body the opportunity to relax. 
                    <br><br>
                    As a student with us, you should be able to safely participate in all classes and meet according to your needs, conditions and thus achieve the best results for you.

                I`ve been struggling for quite a while with hip muscle soreness and pain. I`ve done all sorts of stretching. 
                Took the hip challenge and learned new positions and to give the stretch time under tension. It is making a difference. 
                What I like is I can do it on my time yet if I have questions The Yoga Studio will answer them! Good stuff here.

                I very much appreciate the work and knowledge of The Yoga Studio. They really make it feel right. 
                I find it not always easy to manage to do the exercises daily, but I think if I would, I would tremendously benefit from it. 
                The Yoga Studio, please keep making the wonderful classes and content; it's very good!

                What a great studio! My body is no longer in pain! I feel more energy and I'm looking forward to try the "back challenge" as well. 
                The Yoga Studio´s teachers is great!
