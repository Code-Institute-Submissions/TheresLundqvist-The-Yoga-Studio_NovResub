            <h1>Two words from the Dalai Lama that Destroyed my Ego & Set me Free</h1>
            <p>
                I was the first born grandchild on both sides of the family. I was doted on from day one; I was special.
                Upon entering kindergarten and getting tested, I was deemed gifted and talented. One day each week during the school year, I got to attend school with other gifted children like me; I was special.
                Fast forward to my adulthood. My mom passed away unexpectedly in a motorcycle accident when I was in my mid-20s. I was pregnant before I could legally drink. I was divorced before I finished college. These events made me a different kind of special, but special nonetheless.

                <h1>Your Nervous System on Meditation</h1>
                <p>
                    In the past few years there has been a lot of talk about the nervous system, different activities that can regulate your nervous system, and the impact on your health and vitality resulting from nervous system dysregulation. 
                    As human beings experiencing the ups and downs of life, we often experience nervous system dysregulation throughout our days. The good news is there are many modalities that can help regulate the nervous system, including mindfulness and meditation.

                    <h1>Your Flow State and the Subtle Body</h1>
                    <p>
                        When someone says they’re ‘in Flow’…what is that all about? 
                        Many cultures across time/space speak about ‘flow state’ in different ways;  how to enter it, sustain it, understand what pushes one out of flow & most importantly, how to quickly recover when it’s been lost.
                        ‘Flow state’ is when we’re out of our own way, become an instrument of the divine will, & are like a hollow bone for a greater force to come through.
